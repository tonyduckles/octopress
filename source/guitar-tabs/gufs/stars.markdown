    (Intro)

    (Verses)  2 o'clock on a Friday morning
              heard a voice, thought I heard the phone ring
              I was hoping it was you
              Looked outside and saw it raining
              I saw a face then it started fading
              slowly into view

    (Pre-Chorus) If time could just stand still
                 I wouldn't let you walk away
                 I'd find the words I meant to say

    (Chorus) All my life I've waited for one love
             that I can fall into
             And every line of every song I hear
             reminds me of when I first saw you
             When I saw...

    (Verses) ...stars.
             When I saw stars...
             I saw stars...
             There were days that I watched you sleeping
             I wondereed what you were dreaming
             I hope you know you're not alone

    (Pre-Chorus) If time could just stand still
                 I wouldn't let you walk away
                 I'd find the words to make you stay

    (Chorus) All my life I've waited for one love
             that I can fall into
             And every line of every song I hear
             reminds me about you
             All my life I've waited for one love
             that I can fall into
             And every line of every song I hear
             reminds me of when I first saw you
             When I saw...

    (Verses) ...stars.
             When I saw stars...
             I saw stars...

    (Bridge) Have we made it through the dark?
             Are we in recovery?
             Will my broken heart start to beat?
             It's not a mystery...what you do to me...

    (Chorus) All my life I've waited for one love
             that I can fall into
             And every line of every song I hear
             reminds me about you
             All my life I've waited for one love
             that I can fall into
             And every line of every song I hear
             reminds me about you
             When I saw stars...
             When I saw stars...
             When I saw stars...

    (Ending)
