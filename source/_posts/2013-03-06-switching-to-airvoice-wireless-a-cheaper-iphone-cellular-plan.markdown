For the past two and a half years, I've been rocking my [iPhone 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4).
It's held-up well over the years. My previous phone, an [iPhone 3G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_3G),
was pretty darn sluggish by the end of its two year tenure and I eagerly
awaited the point where I was eligible for a phone-upgrade so that I could
upgrade to the (*at that time*) brand-new iPhone 4.  I just always assumed that
was the "*way it worked*": sign-up for a new two-year contract, get a
subsidized price on a nice shiny-new piece of phone-hardware, and don't really
think twice about the recurring $80+/month phone-bill.

But I didn't realize there were other alternatives...

## Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MVNOs)
While reading though the back-archives of one of my [new favorite finance blogs](/blog/2013/03/03/mr-money-mustache-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/),
I came across an interesting article, "[Our New $10.00 Per Month iPhone Plans](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/11/our-new-10-00-per-month-iphone-plans/)",
talking about switching to a monthly pre-paid plan and paying only $10/month
for an iPhone cellular plan.  I had heard mention of some of these "pre-paid"
cellular vendors before but had never really looked into them much or really
understand what they were:

{% blockquote %}
Many of these new options are called Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MNVOs), and they are in fact just re-selling access to the bigger carriersâ€™ networks. So you get the same reception, coverage, and reliability as you had before.
{% endblockquote %}

I had never realized! Same cellular network/service, you're just paying a
different middle-man. And there's [quite a long list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators)
of these MVNO's, lots of options for each of the major US mobile operators:
AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Reading the comments in that article was
where a lot of the gold was; there's lots of great information in there. A lot
of these MVNO's have been around for quite a while and are pretty
well-established.

So, since my iPhone 4 hardware was still giving my reasonable performance,
I decided to skip the expected hardware-upgrade and stick with my current
handset and try to milk it for all its worth.

## Choosing a Company & Plan
After doing some more reading, I ending-up choosing [Airvoice Wireless](http://www.airvoicewireless.com/)
because they seem to be one of the favorite (and well-established) AT&T-based
MVNO's and they have [lots of different plan options](http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/).

Since my phone is *already* setup to run on AT&T's GSM network, you wouldn't
even need a carrier-unlock to be able to jump to one of the AT&T MVNO's because
it's still using the same carrier network behind-the-scenes.  Though, truth be
told, since I was out of my 2-year contract with AT&T, I did make use of AT&T's
[free carrier-unlock](http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532&cv=820&title=What%20are%20the%20eligibility%20requirements%20for%20unlocking%20iPhone%3F#fbid=eGlx2oAwj-R)
before ditching my AT&T plan so that I could use my handset when traveling
internationally should the opportunity arise...

I considered going the ultra-frugal [$10/month Talk & Text](http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/10-plan/)
plan but that seemed a bit too restrictive. I'm coming from my AT&T plan which
had 450 anytime minutes (*though I only used on average ~100 minutes per month
and had a huge rollover pool*) and my grandfathered-in Unlimited data plan from
my original iPhone 3G based plan. I usually averaged around 200MB-300MB of data
per month, so I wasn't really reaping much from my Unlimited data-plan.  The
ultra-frugal $10/month plan would mean I'd *really* need to scrutinize my
cellular data usage (*$0.33/MB adds up quick!*), as in *turning-off* cellular
data most of the time and only turning it on when I absolutely needed. That was
just a bit too extreme for me &mdash; too much penny-pinching.

So, to make my transition from AT&T to Airvoice Wireless as painless as
possible, I opted for their [$40/month Unlimited Plan with Data](http://www.airvoicewireless.com/plans-2/unlimited-plans-with-data/40-unlimited-plan-with-data/)
which has unlimited talk & text (*neither of which I use much of*) and
500MB of data per month.

## Making the Switch
Here's a quick summary of the setup/transition process...

* Bought a Airvoice Wireless SIM card through their website. It arrived in a
  few business days.
* Activate the SIM card on Airvoice Wireless's website, picked which plan I
  wanted to use, got a phone number assigned to my new account (*or you could
  have ported your existing cell number to Airvoice*), and put some money into
  my account.
* Using [some print-out templates](http://amjath.com/2010/08/how-to-make-a-micro-sim-from-a-normal-sim.html)
  I found online (*and putting on my arts-and-crafts hat*), I trimmed the
  normal-sized SIM card to the micro-SIM size to fit my iPhone SIM card tray.
* Drop the new SIM card into my iPhone. No need to turn-off or power-cycle.
  It connected to the Airvoice Wireless network immediately. You'll notice
  the `AIRVOICE WIRELESS` vendor banner on the upper-left of your iPhone screen.
* To get cellular data working, you need to install the correct Access Point
  Name (APN) settings for Airvoice Wireless. Just connect to Wi-Fi, fire-up
  Mobile Safari on your iPhone, navigate to [http://www.unlockit.co.nz/](http://www.unlockit.co.nz/),
  select "Airvoice", and click Install. It will prompt you to install a new
  Profile with the APN settings for Airvoice. With the correct APN settings
  in-place, I turned off Wi-Fi and the 3G data worked as normal.

Easy-peasy.

## Initial Observations
It's only been a few weeks so far, but all-in-all the transition has
been extremely painless.

### Pro's:

* **I cut my phone-bill in <u>half</u>**: $85/month -> $40/month. Yowza!
* **Same cellular service**, since I'm still effectively using AT&T's network.
* **Not locked into another contract.** I can switch to another vendor whenever
  I want, if for some reason I don't like Airvoice. That kind of agility is
  refreshing.

### Con's:

* **No integrated iPhone visual voicemail**, at least that I know of.  (*Though
  this doesn't bother me much because I ported my number to Google Voice as
  part of this transition, but that's a story for another time...*)
* **Need to remember to login every 30 days to renew your service.** This could
  admittedly be a bit of a drag, but it's easy to add a monthly reminder, and a
  few extra minutes worth of work per month seems well worth the savings of
  $40/month x 12 months = ~$500/year.
* **No fancy website.** AT&T had a pretty decent website with all kinds of
  historical usage statistics. I get none of that now. Airvoice is a smaller
  operation and I'm okay with that. If I want to get usage stats, I just need
  to do it myself using the usage-counters on my iPhone.

Even if some months I do happen to go over my 500MB/month cap, I would simply
drop another $40 in my account early and that would restart the 30 day
expiration over again.  As I understand it, a given prepayment expires either:
after 30 days or after you've used up your quota, whichever comes first.

If I find the $40/month plan is either too limiting or I'm consistently not
using everything I'm paying for, I can always easily switch to a different
plan/tier. Based on the Airvoice Wireless [terms of service](http://www.airvoicewireless.com/TermsOfServiceAll.aspx),
it sounds like they won't refund you a partial-month at all; you need to make a
cut at the end of your 30 day cycle (to make the most of your money) and you
need to call customer-service to switch your account over to the new plan. I
(obviously) haven't tried this yet but it sounds pretty painless.

And by saving **$500/year** on my cell phone bill, that's basically the price
of a brand-new (unlocked) flagship phone. So, I could *still* upgrade my
hardware and still come-out ahead because I'm not tied into an expensive
contract with one of the big cellular companies.

It will be interesting to see how this plays-out over the next few months, to
see what happens to my service at the end of a 30-day cycle (e.g. *how apparent
will it be that my service has cut off and that I need to pump more money into
my account?*), to see how often I use up my 500MB quota before the 30 days are
up, etc. I'm just darn excited to have interesting new options/alternatives.
