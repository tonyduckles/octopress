I have confidence in Google's ability to keep their e-mail service up-and-
running and keep proper backups of data, but my e-mail history is _my_ data
and I like to have my own copy of it. Since Google provides access to your
Google Apps (and Gmail) e-mail over IMAP, you can do all kinds of things using
standard tools, e.g. synchronize your Gmail e-mail to a local mailbox using
IMAP.

I run an Ubuntu box at home and it was easy to install the `dovecot-imapd`
package to get an IMAP server installed. Since my box is behind my
router/firewall, I'm wasn't that concerned with tweaking Dovecot's default
configuration, but I'm sure you could fiddle with the config to ensure that
Dovecot only binds to `127.0.0.1`.

From there, it's just a matter of using `imapsync`, just like I ended-up
using previously to
[initially transfer all my e-mail to my Google Apps account](/blog/2010/08/07/moving-e-mail-from-gmail-to-google-apps-over-imap-using-imapsync/).

Here's the script:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
 # Sync e-mail from "username@yourdomain.com" to localhost, using IMAP
 imapsync --host1 imap.gmail.com --user1 username@yourdomain.com
          --passfile1 /path/to/gmail_mirror.passfile1 \
          --host2 localhost --user2 username
          --passfile2 /path/to/gmail_mirror.passfile2 \
          --ssl1 \
          --useheader 'Message-Id' --skipsize --allowsizemismatch \
          --syncinternaldates --noauthmd5 -nofoldersizes\
          --split1 100 --split2 100 \
          --regextrans2 's/\[Gmail\]/username\@somedomain/' \
          --include "All Mail|Sent Mail" --delete2 --expunge2
{% endcodeblock %}

The `--regextrans2` option rewrites IMAP folder-names on-the-fly, so that my
local IMAP folder structure can be different than the structure on Gmail's
server. For example, the top Gmail IMAP folder is `[Gmail]` which wasn't all
that useful for me, so instead I rewrote that top-level folder to be
`username@somedomain` so that the local folder name (e.g. in `~/mail/`) would
match the source e-mail address.

You can also use the `--include` option to decide which IMAP folders to copy.
I opted to just copy "All Mail" and "Sent Mail", which gives me a copy of all
my mail but doesn't preserve any information about the labels I might have had
assigned to those messages in Gmail.

The initial copy will definitely take a few hours (or more), depending on how
much e-mail you have in your Gmail account. But this works great for me and
stores the mail in "mbox" format locally so I can even access the mail locally
via mutt/alpine/etc.
