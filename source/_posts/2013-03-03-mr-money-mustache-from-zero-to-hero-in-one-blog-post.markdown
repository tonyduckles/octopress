I really love this blog. Lots of great financial and lifestyle advice here, and
I really identify with his philosophy:

{% blockquote %}

The bottom line is this: by focusing on happiness itself, you can lead a much
better life than those who focus on convenience, luxury, and following the lead
of the financially illiterate herd that is the TV-ad-absorbing Middle Class of
the United States today (and most of the other rich countries).  Happiness
comes from many sources, but none of these sources involve car or purse
upgrades. No matter what the herd or the TV set tells you, this is the truth.
