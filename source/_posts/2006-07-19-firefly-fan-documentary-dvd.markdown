I finally succumbed to recommendations of friends and picked-up the Firefly TV
series on DVD...and it definitely didn't fail to impress. It's the best sci-fi
show I've seen in a long time. It reminds me of ST:TNG in some ways, in so
much as it's very character-driven, with engaging characters who are developed
very nicely. I would certainly recommend it to any sci-fi fans who haven't had
a chance to see it yet.

The fan community for Firefly seems to be alive and strong, and it looks like
a [fan-compiled Firefly documentary](http://www.donetheimpossible.com/) is on
the verge of being released. I'm still debating picking it up... I know I can
get fanatical about some things, but I'm not sure if I'm too that point with
Firefly yet. I certainly wish that the TV series hadn't been cancel mid-1st-
season.
