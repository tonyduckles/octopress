I don't know about you, but I remember playing a fair amount of
[Street Fighter 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fighter#Street_Fighter_II) back
in the day. College Humor is running this hilarious
[series](http://www.collegehumor.com/tag:streetfighterthelateryears), looking
into the lives of the Street Fighter combatants...10 years later. \*insert
suspenseful music here!\*
