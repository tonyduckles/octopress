I really dig the whole web-based RSS aggregator/reader thing. For the past
year or so, I've been using [reBlog](http://www.reblog.org/) on my Linux box
at home. It had it's quirks, but it was great to use.

Enter **[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/)**. Being the show-off's
they are, Google has created a fantastic RSS reader web-app. I've ditched my
home-based reBlog setup for using Google Reader for all my RSS feed reading
needs. Here are the things which really won me over:

<!-- more -->

* Super-slick UI, with fantastic keyboard navigation support.
* Nifty AJAX tricks, like only loading enough items into the ListView to fit
on screen initially and then fetching more as you scroll down. (_Of course,
they do this for performance reasons, but it's still implemented very cleanly
and just "feels" nice._)
* You can "star"/flag entries that are useful, and then go back and look at
all the articles you've flagged. It remembers the timestamp of when you
flagged the entry, which I find handy. (_Though most useful links I consume
in a [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/tduckles)-fashion these days..._)
* You can easily sort either by Oldest or Newest, and it saves that preference
on each "view" (i.e. viewing entries from just one feed vs all entries) you have.
* Has an "infinite" scrollback feature, to allow you to scroll backwards through
all the posts which Google has ever fetched for that feed.
* It's free. ;)

I would definitely recommend Google Reader to anyone that uses a fat-client
RSS reader/aggregator, especially if you want something that does the
aggregating 24-7 for you and is accessible from any computer.
