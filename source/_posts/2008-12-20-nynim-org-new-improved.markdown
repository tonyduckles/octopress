I've resurrected my nearly abandoned website and breathed new life into it!
I'm now running **[SweetCron](http://www.sweetcron.com/)**, an open-source
project for rolling you own personalized lifestream.

<!-- more -->

I find that I don't always have the inspiration or motivation to write blog
posts that often, but I do have a Web 2.0 foot-print that other people might
want to watch, whether it be sharing interesting news tidbits on
[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09011817463293213634) to
bookmarking useful webpages on [Del.icio.us](http://delicious.com/tduckles),
to what songs I love on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/tonyduckles).

Hence, the birth of this lifestream: all my various online activities
aggregated and presenting in a unified "lifestream". This gives others an easy
way to check-out what I'm up to. If you have any comments or feedback, drop me
an e-mail!
